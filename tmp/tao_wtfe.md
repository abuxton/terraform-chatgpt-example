# Tao of What the Fuck (WTF) Engineering

The practice of embracing mistakes, errors, and confusion as a means of developing creative solutions to challenging and complex problems. The core concepts of the Tao include:

1. Embrace failure: Failure is an integral part of the engineering process. Acknowledge when things don’t work and use that as an opportunity to learn something new.

2. Be curious: This is key to discovering unexpected solutions. Let your curiosity drive you to challenge the status quo by examining assumptions, deleting code, and reinventing the wheel.

3. Remain open-minded: Don’t let yourself be limited by your current knowledge. Strive to learn from a variety of sources to gain a broader understanding of the problem and potential solutions.

4. Experiment: Use what you’ve learned to try out different approaches and do not be afraid to fail.

5. Take time to reflect: Using the time between coding sprints to reflect on what you’ve learned and think through alternatives is critical to finding innovative solutions. Taking a step back allows you to better evaluate the efficiency of your code and find a different approach.
