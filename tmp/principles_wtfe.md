# Principles of What the Fuck (WTF) engineering

A set of the guidelines which strive to reduce the amount of time wasted by developers when dealing with complex problems or troubleshooting non-intuitive technologies. They emphasize the importance of being prepared, not giving up too quickly, and being creative in trying to find a solution. The principles include:

1. WTF First: Approach every problem as if you have no idea what the hell is going on.

2. Think it Through: Carefully consider all of the possibilities and slowly hone in on a possible solution.

3. Refactor: Change the problem into one you can solve by breaking the problem down into manageable chunks.

4. Test and Iterate: Once you have identified a possible solution, test it, and if it fails, go back and re-evaluate.

5. Don't be Afraid to Ask: If you don't know, ask around and get a second opinion or help from someone experienced with the problem.

6. Consolidate: Think through all of the solutions you have tried and bring them together into one concise and well-rounded answer.

7. Document your Understanding: Document your process to ensure that you learn from your experience and can refer to it or share with someone else.
